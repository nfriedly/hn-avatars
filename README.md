# HN Avatars
UserScript to generate avatars next to usernames on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). 

This script may be installed manually or from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/460206-hn-avatars). Run it with a tool such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), see Greasy Fork for other options.

Script is based on [Show HN: HN Avatars in 357 bytes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30668137) with additional changes from the comments and some of my own incoporated.
