# HN Avatars
UserScript to generate avatars next to usernames on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). 

Run it with a tool such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), see https://greasyfork.org/ for other options.

Script is based on https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30668137 with additional changes from the comments and some of my own incoporated.

See also https://github.com/ekofi/hn_avatar_ext for an extension version
